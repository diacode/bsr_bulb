# BSRBulb

An Elixir library for interacting with a [BSR Smart Bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFEzDolYsK0)
that is connected via bluetooth. This an RGB LED Bulb with built-in speaker.

It seems there are others brands that sell this bulb under his own name. Some of
them are:

* 1byone
* ...

##Â Supported features

* Switch on
* Switch off
* Set color

## Usage

On Mac OS X, pair your computer with your bulb by using the normal Bluetooth
device explorer. One connected, you should hear a sound coming from the
bulb's speaker.

Then you need to find the serial port for your bulb. You can use `ls /dev | grep tty`. For the 1byone version the port is `/dev/tty.1byoneBulb-SerialPortSe`.

Then open an elixir terminal with `iex -S mix` and type:

```elixir
device = "/dev/tty.1byoneBulb-SerialPortSe"
{:ok, bulb} = BSRBulb.Client.start(device)
BSRBulb.Client.switch_on(bulb)
BSRBulb.Client.set_color(bulb, "#ff0000") # Red
BSRBulb.Client.switch_off(bulb)
```

## Acknowledgments

This library was based on the [Sphero](https://github.com/knewter/sphero) library. While the bulb and Sphero are different devices both are
controlled through Bluetooth using [erlang-serial](https://github.com/knewter/erlang-serial).
